                <p>Because the time is right. November 2021. In fact it is well
                    overdue. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Goldsmith" target="_Blank">Teddy Goldsmith</a> wanted to launch it c1980
                    but formed the Green Party. Now 40+ years on we have the need for
                    such, to all, for the leadership and guidance globally, in their
                    need to be self assured, that a solid and honest philosophically centered
                    ethical entity based in principles will lead the way. It will assist in building a future we all
                    need. Not only for man but for all species sharing this planet,
                    living in harmony with nature.</p>
                <p><a href="wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mollison">Bill Mollison</a> also wanted to
                    launch the Permaculture Party C 1990 but that was beyond most
                    peoples comprehension. His energy was needed more in building the
                    global network of good designers of all Permaculture systems on the
                    ground. Such is now a commonly recognised term thanks to Bill's
                    entrepreneurial extroverted spirit.</p>
                <p>Doesn't The Green Party satisfy all such political aspirations and needs?
                    Sadly no. As a founding member of the New Zealand Green Party
                    C 1988 I recognise it has now evolved to be a disgrace to the term,
                    Either infiltrated or sold out. A major political void needs to be flled
                    to offer a strong root to all that such a philosophy encompasses and as
                    formidable preference to the tyranny overtaking the world today in 2021.</p>
                <p>There is also need for a totally new view on politics, a new political
                    theory to move beyond and outside of the regimes that have
                    manipulated this world for the past two thousand years. The Ecologist
                    Party explores new dimensions on every topic of life, communication
                    and connection. Such is firmly rooted in our umbilical connection to
                    nature. This is our true being. It is not based purely in economic growth
                    or workers rights or the manipulation of all by a greedy minority who
                    dictate all monetarist regimes of the world, designing diversion to
                    suffocate our comprehension of what is evolving in the shadows.</p>
                <p>A view on politics that nourishes the interest and rekindles peoples
                    desire to be involved at all levels, from the neighbourhood, to the
                    village, district, region, nation and globally as connected communities
                    through cooperatives and commons equally.</p>

                <H1 class="text-center">How</H1>
                <h2 class="text-center">Will the Party Grow?</h2>
                <p>This evolution began some time ago and is slowly coming to fruition
                    now in October 2021. Will it grow? To What? Where? When? And how?</p>
                <p>A good journey has a vision. In this case it also has a need 
                    driven by an energy that is deep seated perhaps in an astrological field
                    suggesting the planets are lining up to make this possible in many
                    ways.</p>
                <p>The Ecologist Party offers a new dimension in politics. It offers a
                    transition out of an old world of abuse to a new world of respect to
                    cherish the values of the bounty of all life in all its myriad of forms. We
                    are presently in transit to a new age dawning. The Ecologist Party
                    recognises the many different activities occurring globally all aligned in
                    the same spheres of influence. We are but one paving the journey
                    together. So lets stimulate it and add fuel for the journey.</p>
                <p>Our <b>Blog</b> which we offer is informal diary-style text entries to
                    stimulate thought, ideas and debate to invite discussion, discourse and
                    argument so we can all learn and grow from such banter. It will be
                    spasmodic and depend on what energies exist to propell it at any given
                    time.</p>
                <p>Our <b>Newsletter</b> will be far more formal and be out every
                    quarter...Spring 1st of Spring; Summer 1st of December; Autumn 1st of
                    March; and Winter 1st of June. It will update us on as many topics as
                    possible and call for guest articles and stories, debate and contoversy as
                    well as lots of good positive news and views.</p>
                <p>Lets <b>Chat</b> so we can develop the banter and continue to explore the
                    roadmap of our journey. Not one of us will have all the answers but
                    collectively we will explore the pathway we are on. We will question and
                    lay down ideas for stimulation and thought we, will reflect and traverse
                    any subject that could be considered to fit into our cauldron.</p>
                <p>We will <b>Meet</b> in as many ways as possible online and face to face.
                    They all have value and personality. Our meetings could be of any size 
                    culminating in our annual face to face general meetings which will be
                    the forum for the official progression of any decisions for our journey.
                    Our formal meetings will utilise the value of <b>decision by consensus</b>.
                    Such has been well proven to be the most efficient way of decision
                    making by knowing that all engaged agree with the directions to be
                    taken without dissent or contrary aggression.</p>
                <p>Our <b>process</b> and <b>procedures</b> will recognise the fluidity needed to
                    engage all while also recognising the traction needed to progress
                    positively, keeping in mind that the laws of nature bind us and guide us.
                    Our constitution outlines these chosen tools.</p>

                <p>The Ecologist Party was founded in New Zealand October 2021. It has
                    as its base in the manifesto a connection with the natural realm of New
                    Zealand and its indigenous people the Maori. Maoridom has a solid
                    basis of connection to all things in nature and the indigenous peoples
                    of the world. Such a dynamic forms a rich catalyst to evolve an ecological
                    point of view. We learn from all. I have spoken with many globally who see
                    such a political energy to be a valuable contribution to their world and
                    communities. So a global extension is obvious. The inherent social
                    ecology will link all like minded entities, tradition and lore.</p>
                <p>We invite any such energy to come on board...its going to be great ride. <br>
                    The bus is heading to the train station.
                    Jump on board its going to
                    be an exciting journey.</p>
