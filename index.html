            <p>As an Ecology Architect I have fused together the worlds and disciplines of
                Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Urban Design with Systems Ecology
                from a strong vein in Permaculture. Permaculture is a Design Philosophy based
                from an ethic charged by principles. Such has set the ground for the evolution of
                this challenge. As an architect it is a design exercise, ongoing. It will evolve like any
                living ecological system.</p>
            <p>I have also for a long while, since secondary school as a 15 year old, been intrigued
                by the place of politics in society. The reality is there will always be people who
                volunteer their energy and enthusiasm for administration services to our
                community. Politics is just a simple extension of that. Consequently I have had
                many a foray into many layers of politics. I was one of the founding members of the
                Green Party in New Zealand, c1988, and spent time with The Green
                Party of Germany picking up many of their resource dynamics, c1977, also much
                cherished time with Teddy Goldsmith a founder of the Green Party and The
                Ecologist movement and Bill Mollison co-founder of the Permaculture movement.</p>
            <p>The culmination of many elements like these has bought about the desire to evolve
                a new form of politics. The Ecologist Party is that. It is an all encompassing
                dynamic requiring a shift in many conditioned patterns and much of what we have
                learnt. It does require degrees of unlearning, but it has a very firm base in
                something all living form is connected to as we, as just another species sharing this
                planet, are all connected to the same.</p>
            <p>Along the way I have met many talented learned valuable people who have added to
                this dimension in an array of ways. That list is extensive and continues to grow.
                Does the tail wag the dog? This tale I'm sure will.</p>
            <p>This website was launched in October 2021 and will continually evolve but always
                stay true to the base philosophy that we are all grounded ecologically and deserve
                to enliven this connection and all its linkages, for after all, that is what ecology is,
                the biology of connections and linkages.</p>
            <p>Through the website we use the iconic New Zealand native bird the Tui. It has a
                song that all New Zealanders know well, which conjures up our connections with
                our great outdoors. Ironically the Tui borrows many of its songs from other birds and
                noises in its environment. The Tui has become our icon.</p>
